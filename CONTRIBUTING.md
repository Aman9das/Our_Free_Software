Right now we are looking to [collect](https://github.com/Aman9das/Our_Free_Software/discussions/2) resources to base ourselves off of, and to create the skeletal structure of the series.

Feel free to join the [discussions](https://github.com/Aman9das/Our_Free_Software/discussions/1) and suggest ideas.

## Meet the team

We also have a [Matrix Room](https://matrix.to/#/#Our_Free_Software:matrix.org). Feel free to ask questions and hang out here. :smiley:
